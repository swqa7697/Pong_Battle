There are two modes in this Pong game, Player vs. Player and Player vs. AI. The rules for both modes
are the same, and the first one who gets 5 points wins. In addition to the classic Pong game, some 
new features were added in. So, besides moving the paddles, players can use abilities with a certain
amount of cooldown time. For instance, players can boost both the ball and the paddle's speed, stick 
the ball to the paddle after touching or expand the paddle to better defend the gate. 

For this game, we want players can have a new experience of playing a Pong game. They may find joy 
for playing against AI or their friends. Especially, when they try to utilize the abilities during 
the game for the first a few times, players will have fun in the process of familiarizing the 
abilities. Also, after a few rounds, when players know when to use what abilities can be the most 
efficient, the game can be interesting and competitive as well.
